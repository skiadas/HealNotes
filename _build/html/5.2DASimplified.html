<h1>The 5.2 DA/Mastery change simplified<a class="headerlink" href="#the-5-2-da-mastery-change-simplified" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I see so many Disc Priests complain that Blizzard just cut their crit heals in half, I thought it would be time to clear things a bit. So I&#8217;m going to put it as plainly as possible hoping it will sink in:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>Our heal and shield numbers are very similar to before. The shield you get from a crit is about the same as you would have gotten under the old system. Similarly, the **average*</em> healing you do is about the same as before. The difference is that instead of doing little regular heals and a large heal on a crit, you do bigger regular heals but no extra healing on crits. This averages out to a large extent.*</div></blockquote>
<p>You want some numbers? Let&#8217;s have some numbers!</p>
<p>But before the numbers, just in case you feel like skipping the longer details, the following table summarizes the results for a sample starting base heal of 10k, and for two hypothetical priests, one focusing more on critical strike the other more on mastery.</p>

</table>
<p>These numbers tell us two things:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The DA shields that the new DA system creates are actually slightly larger than the old system, even more so the more mastery you have.</li>
<li>The average healing you do will in fact go <strong>up</strong> if you were focussing a lot on mastery, and will only go down a bit (about 6%) if you had completely neglected mastery and had fully focussed on Critical Strike.</li>
<li>The average amount of PW:S will go up if you have focused on crit, and will stay about the same if you have focused on mastery.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="let-s-ask-alice">
<h2>Let&#8217;s ask Alice<a class="headerlink" href="#let-s-ask-alice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Critical Alice is a kind-hearted Disc Priest who loves her big crits. She has invested all out in crit rating, and in raid she&#8217;s at around 20%. At the same time, she&#8217;s got about 40% mastery: The 20% she gets from her mother at birth, and extra 12.5% from her fellow Paladin&#8217;s Blessing of Might, and an extra 7.5% from 1800 rating. That&#8217;s in the old system. Let&#8217;s look at her healing.</p>
<div class="section" id="alice-pre-5-2">
<h3>Alice pre-5.2<a class="headerlink" href="#alice-pre-5-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s suppose for simplicity that we are talking about a heal that would normally do 10k healing. The exact amount doesn&#8217;t matter, all computations are proportional to it, but it will help us keep things concrete. I will also discount the crit effect meta to keep the discussion simple.</p>
<p>First let&#8217;s compute the size of the shield when she does crit. A crit heal would have been equal to 20k, hence the divine aegis shield from it would have been <span class="math">\(20k\times 0.5\times 1.40\)</span>, since her 40% mastery would increase the divine aegis effect by 40%. This equals a <strong>14k shield</strong>.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s compute her average healing. Most of the times (80% of them) she heals for 10k, but 20% of the times she heals for 20k. Her average healing would therefore be:</p>
<div class="math">
\[0.8 \times 10k + 0.2 \times 20k = 12k\]</div>
<p>So she would be doing <strong>12k average healing</strong> from casting that spell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alice-post-5-2">
<h3>Alice post-5.2<a class="headerlink" href="#alice-post-5-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now let&#8217;s see how Alice would do with the new system. In the new system her crit percent is still at 20%, but her mastery is now split in two parts: One is a 12.8% increase in her heals, another is a 25.6% increase in her shields.</p>
<p>So what happens now to Alice&#8217;s 10k heal? It is increased by 12.8%, so it is actually equal to 11.28k. Now, when Alice crits, she creates a shield for that amount, scaled by her shield mastery. This would equal <span class="math">\(11.28k\times 1.256 = 14168\)</span>. So now Alice produces a <strong>14168 shield</strong> when she crits, a tad larger than before.</p>
<p>What about her average healing? Since her heals are the same whether she crits or not, she would have <strong>11280 average healing</strong>. This is 6% smaller than her pre-5.2 average healing, so it is a slight nerf, but hardly something to scream about.</p>
<p>Before we summarize, let&#8217;s take a look at another friend of hours:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mastery-bob">
<h3>Mastery Bob<a class="headerlink" href="#mastery-bob" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bob loves his mastery, he went all out on mastery instead of crit. He therefore only has 15% crit, but a whopping 60% mastery. Let&#8217;s see how he would fare. The base heal of 10k, when it crits, would provide a <strong>16k shield</strong>. At the same time, his average healing would be:</p>
<div class="math">
\[0.85\times 10k + 0.15 \times 20k = 11.5k\]</div>
<p>So he does <strong>11.5k average healing</strong>.</p>
<p>In 5.2, he would have 19.2% increase to his heals, and 38.4% increase to his shields. Therefore what used to be a 10k heal will now be a 11.92k heal, and that would also be his <strong>average healing, 11.92k</strong>. His shield on the other hand would be a 38.4% increase on that, namely <strong>16497 shield</strong>.</p>
<p>So Bob&#8217;s shields went up by 3%, and his average healing also went up by 3.6%.</p>
