Adinne's Guide to PvE Discipline
================================

Welcome to Adinne's guide to Disciple. My guide will focus on Discipline Healing for 5.2, and exclusively from a PvE viewpoint.

Why Disc?
---------

Let's start with a simple question, why should you play Discipline Priest? What does Disc bring to the table? The answer is simple and perhaps somewhat expected:

    **Shields**

Well, it's not actually that simple, but it is a key defining characteristic of Disc: There are only two specs in WoW that get a large part of their healing from shields: Discs and Pallies. For Pallies it is a bi-product of their healing, but Discipline is the only class that can bring instant relatively large shields on demand.

So what's the big deal? Well it's something that really sets us apart from other healers. While everyone else can heal the damage, put hots etc, very few classes can shield. We bring **synergy **; we can shield people from damage while our fellow healers heal them up. We work well with other healers; except of course when we get them mad by shielding all the damage and sniping their heals. But it does mean one thing:

    Discipline Priests are **proactive** healers

To excel as a Discipline Priest you have to anticipate the incoming damage, and prevent it even before it happens.

Another somewhat unique feature is Atonement, which can bring considerable extra dps to the raid while producing a fair amount of smart healing. We share that feature with Monks.

Well, after this brief introduction, let's dig in!

Key Abilities
-------------

Let's start with a review of some key abilities that define our healing style. We will go into more details on it later.

1. `Power Word: Shield`_ is perhaps our most recognized ability. It places a powerful shield on the target that lasts for 15 seconds, but also places the Weakened Soul debuff on the target preventing any Priest of placing another PW:S on that target for 15 seconds. It is a powerful ability that can give a player valuable breathing room, or even enable them to survive a devastating attack that would have otherwise killed them.
2. `Atonement`_ enables our main damaging spells to actually heal a friendly target within 40 yards. Combined with `Evangelism`_, which makes those spells considerably stronger and more efficient, this smart healing is a great filler and can add up to a considerable part of our healing. With Penance being affected by it, this is no longer something you just choose to do.
3. `Spirit Shell`_ is an ability we can use once a minute, and it makes most of our heals turn into shields for the next 15 seconds. Capped on each person at 60% of the caster's health, a Priest with some foresight can often completely nullify some boss mechanics. It's not uncommon for this to constitute up to 40% of our healing.
4. `Divine Aegis`_ turns our crits into shields. We will talk more about this later.
5. `Penance`_ is our signature spell, consisting of 3 quick strong bursts of either damage or healing, depending on our mood. Very powerful, very versatile, and now on only a 9 second CD.
6. `Grace`_ builds on any target that we focus with single target heals, increasing our healing on that target by 30%. With a duration of 15 seconds, it is not hard to keep it going on the tanks, and it is a considerable boost to our single target healing abilities.

To sum this up, we have some strong single-target healing abilities that become stronger as we focus on a person, a powerful on demand single-target shield, a strong raid shield on a relatively short CD, and considerable smart healing as we damage the boss. We also have reasonably strong raid healing, and we'll go more into that later.

Full Ability Description
------------------------

I'll try to list all the abilities in our toolkit in as organized a way as possible.

Single Target Healing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have a very diverse toolkit when dealing with single target healing:

- `Atonement`_ causes your `Smite`_, `Holy Fire`_ and `Penance`_ damaging spells to heal a nearby target for an amount (almost) equal to the damage they cause. I say almost because there are some details on how Atonement works, but for all practical purposes it does heal for amount equal to the damage the spells cause.
    - Atonement is reasonably smart in its healing: It will tend to pick the lowest health target within 40 yards, and it only does 50% of its effect if it ends up healing the priest.
    - Atonement has the advantage of being able to dip into many different effects: If there is a damage taken debuff on the target, this means more damage, which means more healing; if there is a healing done or healing taken buff on the target of the heal, this also affects the Atonement heal.
    - A number of glyphs can considerably increase the performance of Atonement. We'll discuss them when we discuss the spells.
- `Evangelism`_ is closely tied to Atonement. It builds up to 5 stacks whenever you use `Smite`_, `Holy Fire`_ and `Penance`_ to do damage, and it has a double effect of both reducing the cost of those spells, and increasing the healing they do. Evangelism is a huge buff to Atonement healing: At 5 stacks, it makes those spells 20% stronger and 70% more mana efficient. The buff lasts for 20 seconds unless it gets refreshed.
- `Penance`_ is by far our hardest hitting ability, both damage- and healing-wise. It consists of a short burst of 3 heals or attacks within 2 seconds. If used for its Atonement effect, it may heal 3 distinct targets with those bursts. It is also extremely mana efficient. But we can only use it every 9 seconds, or 6 seconds if we have the T14 4-set bonus. Given its low mana cost, it is very worth it to consider the `Glyph of Penance`_, which increases its cost by 20% but allows it to be cast while moving.
- `Holy Fire`_ is another extremely efficient heal on a 10 second CD. It is instant cast, and on top of its base damage it leaves a small hot on the target for the next 7 seconds. The `Glyph of Holy Fire`_ increases its range by 10 yards.
- `Smite`_ is our filler Atonement ability, with no CD and only 1.5 second cast time. It more expensive than the other two, but still fairly efficient, especially if you use `Glyph of Smite`_, which buffs Smite's effect by 20% as long as the Holy Fire dot effect is on the target. Every Smite also reduces the CD on Penance by 0.5 seconds.
- `Power Word: Shield`_ is an instant-cast powerful and fairly expensive shield that can be a real life-saver. At the very least, you would want to cast it approximately every 12 seconds to proc `Rapture`_. One important side-effect of it `Borrowed Time`_, which gives you 15% haste on the next spell cast after it (and then some, but we'll discuss this more later). It also puts the `Weakened Soul`_ debuff, which prevent us from casting another shield on that target for 15 seconds.
- `Grace`_ is an important part of single-target healing. Every direct single-target heal on a person adds a stack of Grace, up to 3 stacks, and each stack increases the effectiveness of all our heals on that target, with the exception of PW:S, by 10%. With a duration of 15 seconds, this buff can increase your healing on the target by up to 30%, and keeping this up can considerably increase your healing. It is very customary to get the 3 stacks up and running with a single cast of Penance.
- `Greater Heal`_ is our big slow single-target heal. Using it with `Inner Focus`_ provides a very strong healing effect. When single target healing, this is definitely worth casting instead of Smite when big healing is needed, or even simply to refresh Grace.
- `Flash Heal`_ is of course our fast somewhat large very inefficient heal, but it can be life-saver on occasion.
- `Heal`_ is a slow cheap efficient and small heal, and frankly you won't get to use it much. Smite Atonement healing is much more efficient as a filler, and you're more likely to use a Greater Heal when heavy direct healing is needed. But it can still help you cheaply keep up Grace on a target that doesn't at the moment take a lot of damage.

Well there you have it folks, a pretty long list of spells at our disposal, which does provide a challenge: There are a number of different CDs you need to keep in mind: Penance's CD, Holy Fire's CD, keeping Grace up, possibly keeping Evangelism up if you end up having to shift your focus to raid healing for a bit.

It also means that we need a bit of a ramp-up time when it comes to single target healing. It might take a few GCDs to build 5 stacks of Evangelism and 3 stacks of Grace, but once we have our Atonement heals do 56% more than normal.

AoE healing
~~~~~~~~~~~

Our AoE healing options are considerably fewer. We essentially have the following 4 spells:

    **Prayer of Healing**

Yeah, you noticed I mentioned only one spell too, didn't you?

- `Prayer of Healing`_ is our main AoE spell, using what many would consider a rather archaic system: It will heal everyone in the target's group that is within 30 yards of the target, regardless of line of sight effects. It is in that sense very much so not a smart heal: You have to make sure to have arranged your raid groups so that people in the same group stay close to each other, and/or be careful who you use as your target, as the effect's range is based off that location. In my experience, other healers are good targets, as they tend to be better at staying within reach with the people they need to heal. Whatever you do, avoid using it on that Hunter that tends to stand further back than anyone would think would be necessary.
- `Prayer of Mending`_ is another key AoE heal, that acts in a fairly unique way. It places a buff on the target player, and when that player takes damage it heals them and moves to another target. This jump can happen a total of 5 times, for a total of 6 heals. Alternatively, you can use `Glyph of Prayer of Mending`_ to give up the last jump for a 60% increase on the first heal. If you find yourself frequently refreshing PoM before it is used up, this may be worth it. PoM can be used every 10 seconds, and it will replace any PoM you cast before. PoM is extremely effective if the raid is about to take a lot of damage ticks one after the other, as that would cause it to bounce around a lot. Damage that comes in single bursts reduces PoM's usefulness. On the other hand, two people with dots ticking on them can make full effect of it, as it bounces back and forth between them every time they tick.
- `Binding Heal`_ can be fairly effective on rare occasions, when you and 1 or 2 other people take damage. It heals you and your target, and a third nearby person if `Glyph of Binding Heal`_ is used, at the cost of a 35% more mana.
- `Spirit Shell`_, while strictly speaking not an AoE heal on its own, is often used in a powerful way with PoH. When activated, all your heals for the next 15 seconds instead place a shield on the target, that stacks up to 60% of your health. This is a great thing to do in preparation of a big incoming attack, and with 15 seconds of cast time plus 15 seconds of buff duration you have an almost 20 second window on which to predict the incoming damage. Starting in 5.2, Spirit Shell's effect exactly matches the average effect expected by the corresponding heal, instead of following its own bizarre scaling. 1 minute CD.
- Tier 6 talents are another big source of AoE healing. We will discuss them in detail in the `Talents`_ section.

Our toolkit when it comes to AoE Healing might not be as diverse as other specs, but it can still be quite effective, especially in the preventive form of Spirit Shell.

Cooldowns
~~~~~~~~~

Discipline has a couple very powerful CDs:

- `Archangel`_ exchanges your `Evangelism`_ stacks for a 5% increase in healing per stack, for a maximum benefit of 25% increase in healing. The buff lasts for 18 seconds and the ability has a 30 second CD. It is a common pattern to use Atonement healing and stack Evangelism during low damage phases, then pop Archangel for heavy Greater Heal or Prayer of Healing spam.
- `Power Word: Barrier`_ is a 3 minute raid CD that places a huge bubble on the ground, that reduces all damage taken by anyone standing under it by 25%. The bubble lasts for 10 seconds.
- `Pain Suppression`_ is a 3 minute single target CD that reduces the damage your target would take by 40% for 8 seconds.
- `Void Shift`_ TODO

Buffs and Utilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We round our review of Disc abilities with the various buffs, both personal and raidwide, that we bring to the table, and other Utility spells.

- `Power Word: Fortitude`_ is the standard 10% Stamina buff that all priests can bring.
- `Inner Fire`_ and `Inner Will`_ are essentially the two "stances" you can be in. Inner Fire increases your spell power by 10% and your armor by 60% (more if you use the `Glyph of Inner Fire`_), while Inner Will increases your movement speed by 10% and reduces the cost of your instant spells by 15%.
- `Renew`_ is not typically part of our arsenal, as it is somewhat weaker than our other spells, but it is another thing you can cast on the run. Also take a look at the discussion of Borrowed Time.
- `Dispel Magic`_ is an offensive dispel, removing one magic effect from the target.
- `Mass Dispel`_ is as powerful as it is expensive. At a 15 second CD, costing 40k mana, and with a 15 yard radius of effect around the targeted location, it will remove all harmful effects from friendly players and 1 beneficial effect from all enemy targets, with a maximum of 10 targets each.
- `Purify`_ is our friendly single target dispel. On an 8 second CD, it will remove all magic and disease effects from the target.
- `Hymn of Hope`_ is an interesting mana regeneration effect. It has an extremely long CD, at 6 minutes, and has to be channeled for 8 seconds. As it is channeled, it picks 3 targets with low mana every 2 seconds, and restores 2% of their mana, in addition to increasing their total maximum mana by 15% for the next 8 seconds. It has a total of 12 mana restores. There are two key things to keep in mind in connection to HoH:
    - The increase to the maximum mana pool is an important side-effect when combined with other effects that are based off our mana pool, like `Shadowfiend`_, `Mindbender`_ or `Innervate`_. It is customary to cast those effect right before HoH (as it is a channeled ability that should not be interrupted once it starts).
    - HoH effects from multiple priests can stack, providing some a considerable temporary increase in your maximum mana pool when combined. Coupled with the previous point and some coordination, the mana gains can be considerable.
    - HoH has a very long channel time, make sure you are able to maintain the channel.
    - There is one rare and extreme case where you might want to cancel the channel early. Even one tick will provide 3 people, hopefully healers, with a 15% increase in their maximum mana pool for 8 seconds, in particular providing those healers with 45k temporary mana for the remaining 8 seconds. Depending on circumstances, using this temporary mana before the 8 seconds are over might be more crucial than the mana gains from continuing the channel.
- `Fear Ward`_ can provide one person immunity from fear once every 3 minutes, or 2 if `Glyph of Fear Ward`_ is used.
