The 5.2 DA/Mastery change simplified
====================================

I see so many Disc Priests complain that Blizzard just cut their crit heals in half, I thought it would be time to clear things a bit. So I'm going to put it as plainly as possible hoping it will sink in:

    *Our heal and shield numbers are very similar to before. The shield you get from a crit is about the same as you would have gotten under the old system. Similarly, the **average** healing you do is about the same as before. The difference is that instead of doing little regular heals and a large heal on a crit, you do bigger regular heals but no extra healing on crits. This averages out to a large extent.*

You want some numbers? Let's have some numbers!

But before the numbers, just in case you feel like skipping the longer details, the following table summarizes the results for a sample starting base heal of 10k, and for two hypothetical priests, one focusing more on critical strike the other more on mastery.

=========  ====== =======   ======  =======
Who        Critical Alice     Mastery Bob
---------  --------------   ---------------
When       Pre5.2 Post5.2   Pre5.2  Post5.2
=========  ====== =======   ======  =======
Avg Heal    12000   11280    11500    11920
DA Shield   14000   14170    16000    16500
Avg PW:S    14000   15000    16000    15900
=========  ====== =======   ======  =======

These numbers tell us two things:

1. The DA shields that the new DA system creates are actually slightly larger than the old system, even more so the more mastery you have.
2. The average healing you do will in fact go **up** if you were focussing a lot on mastery, and will only go down a bit (about 6%) if you had completely neglected mastery and had fully focussed on Critical Strike.
3. The average amount of PW:S will go up if you have focused on crit, and will stay about the same if you have focused on mastery.

Let's ask Alice
---------------

Critical Alice is a kind-hearted Disc Priest who loves her big crits. She has invested all out in crit rating, and in raid she's at around 20%. At the same time, she's got about 40% mastery: The 20% she gets from her mother at birth, and extra 12.5% from her fellow Paladin's Blessing of Might, and an extra 7.5% from 1800 rating. That's in the old system. Let's look at her healing.

Alice pre-5.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's suppose for simplicity that we are talking about a heal that would normally do 10k healing. The exact amount doesn't matter, all computations are proportional to it, but it will help us keep things concrete. I will also discount the crit effect meta to keep the discussion simple.

First let's compute the size of the shield when she does crit. A crit heal would have been equal to 20k, hence the divine aegis shield from it would have been :math:`20k\times 0.5\times 1.40`, since her 40% mastery would increase the divine aegis effect by 40%. This equals a **14k shield**.

Now let's compute her average healing. Most of the times (80% of them) she heals for 10k, but 20% of the times she heals for 20k. Her average healing would therefore be:

.. math:: 0.8 \times 10k + 0.2 \times 20k = 12k

So she would be doing **12k average healing** from casting that spell.

Alice post-5.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now let's see how Alice would do with the new system. In the new system her crit percent is still at 20%, but her mastery is now split in two parts: One is a 12.8% increase in her heals, another is a 25.6% increase in her shields.

So what happens now to Alice's 10k heal? It is increased by 12.8%, so it is actually equal to 11.28k. Now, when Alice crits, she creates a shield for that amount, scaled by her shield mastery. This would equal :math:`11.28k\times 1.256 = 14168`. So now Alice produces a **14168 shield** when she crits, a tad larger than before.

What about her average healing? Since her heals are the same whether she crits or not, she would have **11280 average healing**. This is 6% smaller than her pre-5.2 average healing, so it is a slight nerf, but hardly something to scream about.

Before we summarize, let's take a look at another friend of hours:

Mastery Bob
~~~~~~~~~~~

Bob loves his mastery, he went all out on mastery instead of crit. He therefore only has 15% crit, but a whopping 60% mastery. Let's see how he would fare. The base heal of 10k, when it crits, would provide a **16k shield**. At the same time, his average healing would be:

.. math:: 0.85\times 10k + 0.15 \times 20k = 11.5k

So he does **11.5k average healing**.

In 5.2, he would have 19.2% increase to his heals, and 38.4% increase to his shields. Therefore what used to be a 10k heal will now be a 11.92k heal, and that would also be his **average healing, 11.92k**. His shield on the other hand would be a 38.4% increase on that, namely **16497 shield**.

So Bob's shields went up by 3%, and his average healing also went up by 3.6%.
